        <h1>What is this project about?</h1>
        <h3>This is a prototype of a genre in which I am making a project in - virtual tryon. This market has been rapidly expanding in the upcoming years, and I decided to make a project because of this.</h3>
        <h1>Virtual Tryon?</h1>
        <h3>Virtual Tryon is the use of devices for testing and trying out wearables via the device(and not in-person) before buying.</h3>
        <h1>You can see three buttons in the home screen. The first one stops/pauses video, the second one starts/resumes video, and the third resets Orbit Controls(thing you can use to move the screen and see how things look like in side view).</h1>
        <h2>Make sure that your face can be seen clearly, be, ideally 1-2 feet from the camera, and click the second button</h2>
        <h2>Wait for the program to load.</h2>
        <h3>When the loader stops, you should see a "mask" almost on your face</h3>
        <h1>On the right of the program you will see a black bar with many folders each having options. Click these olders</h1>
        <h1>PLAY AROUND! Check out the settings. Reload the page to reset them.</h1>
