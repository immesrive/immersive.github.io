<p>Improve device integration for your Web App in just a few minutes</p>

<p>This was a feature I had set aside an afternoon to implement but in the end it only needed a moment and made the experience significantly better.</p>

<p>Web Share Target allows your Web App to receive URLs from the operating systems just like native apps do.</p>

<p>In the video below I use the share button in Samsung Internet to share the website’s URL with my Web App, which then retrieves and displays the associated feed information from the website.</p>

<p>You add a Web Share target by adding the information into the Web App Manifest:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
 <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">share_target</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">action</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">/feed/</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">method</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">GET</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">params</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">title</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">title</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">text</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">text</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">url</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">url</span><span class="dl">"</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
 <span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When it’s shared, it will open your WebApp at the following URL /feed/?url=[share url]&amp;text=[share text]&amp;title=[share title]. Not all of these get filled out, depending on what is being shared and what is sharing it.</p>

<p>When sharing web pages to the app sometimes, the URL was in the text field rather than the URL field. So if you are expecting a URL you should probably check there as well.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">search</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">URL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">[http://example.com](http://example.com)</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">URLSearchParams</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">search</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">sharedURL</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="nx">params</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kd">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">url</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">||</span>
  <span class="nx">params</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kd">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">text</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are more options you can add to the share_target, for advanced features like sharing files, you can find out more information in the great article on web.dev:

<p><em>Note</em>: At this writing, the Web Share Target API is implemented in some browsers (notably Chromium-based browsers like Samsung Internet) but it is still considered experimental and in “incubation” <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-share-target/">within the W3C</a>. Make sure you take this into account when incorporating Web Share Target into your development plans.</p>
