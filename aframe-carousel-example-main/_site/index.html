			<article><p>IFrames are really useful for WebXR. Often WebXR web pages are large with a lot of code and many 3D frameworks default to taking up all the available space on the page. IFrames solve these issues by letting you put all the XR code into another webpage, which can even be on a different domain, they also let you choose exactly how much space they take up on the page and can be used with Flexbox and CSS Grid.</p></article>
